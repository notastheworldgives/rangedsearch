Ranged Search for Ultimate Member (Numbers Only)

This is a plugin I originally paid to have developed, released to the general public.

This code works to add support for number ranges through the native Member Search UI in Ultimate Member.

The original coding was done by a user by the name of picaro3535. He can be reached at picaro3535@gmail.com if you wish to hire him for more customizations or have specific questions about this product. 

He is under no obligation to provide support for this project, other than the initial work he has done here.
